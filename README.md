## SERVER SIDE RENDERING(SSR)

```
   - THE USER REQUESTS FOR A WEB PAGE (VIA A BROWSER).
   - THE BROWSER THEN CONNECTS TO THE SERVER, WHICH ALREADY HAS THE PRE-RENDERED HTML AND CSS CODE FOR THE PAGE.
   - THE HTML AND CSS ARE DISPLAYED ON THE USERâ€™S BROWSER, BUT THE PAGE IS NOT YET INTERACTIVE.
   - THE BROWSER THEN DOWNLOADS THE JAVASCRIPT OF THE PAGE, WHICH IS READILY AVAILABLE ON THE SERVER.
   - THE USER CAN NOW VIEW THE PAGE AND INTERACT WITH THE ELEMENTS.
   - THE BROWSER EXECUTES THE JAVASCRIPT (DOM, OR DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, IS FULLY RENDERED).
   - THE PAGE IS NOW FULLY LOADED AND CAN RESPOND TO THE INTERACTIONS MADE BY THE USER
